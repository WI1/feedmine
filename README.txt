-- SUMMARY --

Feedmine is a Drupal feedback interface to Redmine (http://www.redmine.org),
a rails-based ticket / issue management system. Feedmine provides a block that,
when enabled, allows users to enter website feedback information that is submitted
as a ticket into Redmine automatically, so that the issue can be tracked, assigned
and handled effectively.

Limitations:
Currently, Feedmine only supports MySQL.

-- INSTALLATION --

The Redmine database must be installed on the same database server / instance as
Drupal. See http://www.redmine.org for Redmine installation instructions.
